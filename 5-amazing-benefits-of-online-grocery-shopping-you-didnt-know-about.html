			<h2>5 amazing benefits of online grocery shopping you didn’t know about</h2> 
			<p class="meta">Posted by Admin on 10th May 2014</p> 
			<div class="entry">
				<p>Many shoppers are aware of the common benefits of online shopping: It saves time, reduces stress, and is convenient. Recently, the Tesco Delivery Lab team has also uncovered several indirect benefits that the public may not have been aware about. </p>
				
				<p>Here is what the team has uncovered thus far. </p>
				
				<p><strong>Helps maintain a better diet</strong><br />
					Besides allowing to be more in control of your time, online grocery shopping helps you avoid one of the biggest pitfalls of shopping: Letting your stomach be your shopping guide, which can lead to many unhealthy purchases. This evidence comes from the <a href="http://www.healthista.com/nutrition/shop-online-lose-weight/">International Journal of Behavioural Nutrition and Physical Activity</a>, which found that people who do their grocery shopping online make healthier choices. 
				</p>
				
				<p><strong>Saves the environment and petrol </strong><br />
					Going out to the mall involves many hidden costs that we don’t often take into account: spending money on petrol, the time it takes to get through traffic, and finding a car park spot – none of which you have to bear when shopping online. 
				</p>
				
				<p><strong>Makes you a better budgeter</strong><br />
					Online shoppers are known to get a better grasp of what is being spent on a weekly basis, as they are constantly aware of the amount being spent before checkout, allowing them to be more in control over the expenditure. 
				</p>
				
				<p><strong>It makes mom happier</strong><br />
					Shopping with kids in the grocery aisle can be fun, but it can also lead to many purchases that parents might not have budgeted for. Online grocery shopping removes the potential risk, and enables you to shop for only what you need. 
				</p>

				<p><strong>Worry-free shopping</strong><br />
					Inexperienced shoppers often worry that the produce they choose might not be the freshest or best. By shopping online, customers leave the choosing up to the experts – like Tesco’s personal pickers – who are trained to identify the best possible produce available.
